# Springboard-Capstone2-Yelp

## Why Yelp:
We live in a review oriented world, everything we do it determined by the number of stars a company gets and it usually tells us whether or not we're going there. Yelp is the central hub of all reviews, especially in restraunts so it's the perfect place to start if we want to look at reviews and improve a business.

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to predict if the reviews given are good or bad reviews based on the different words. This is to help see the pattern of things that people would say if they enjoyed their time or disliked their experience at a certain place.

## Getting started:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

The main project is Capstone2_Yelp_Binary
